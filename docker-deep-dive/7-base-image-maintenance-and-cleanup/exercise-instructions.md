### Base Image Maintenance and Cleanup

1. List all currently install Docker images. If you do not have at least three Docker base images at this point, please pull down other Docker images and/or follow the other exercises in this tutorial.

2. Execute the command to remove a base image that you have previously created a container from and note the resulting message.

3. Run the appropriate command to remove the container that Step #2 indicated is preventing the deletion of that base image.

4. List all previously run containers and remove all of them one at a time. Verify that the command to list stopped containers shows nothing before continuing.

5. Rerun the command executed in Step #2 and then list the base images on your system.
